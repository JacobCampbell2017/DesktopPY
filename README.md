# DesktopPY

This script is designed to clean up the desktop by moving specific types of files into a new folder labeled with the current date and time. 

Note: 
1. The script should be placed in its own folder on the desktop.
2. The script assumes the desktop folder is the parent folder of the current directory.

Files to be cleaned:
- PDF files
- Images (JPEG files)
- Text files
- PowerPoint files
- Word document files

If you want to add more file types to be cleaned, add them to the 'extensions' list within the py file.
